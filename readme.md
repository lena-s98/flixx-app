# Flixx Movie App

Deployment Link: <a target=_blank href="https://imaginative-kashata-5d5e4b.netlify.app">Flixx App</a>

In this application we make a request to the TMDB API.

https://www.themoviedb.org/

We then use the data to insert them into the DOM and create
the movie/show cards.

## Functions:

- The website shows you 20 popular movies and tv shows in a grid
- It also has a slider at the top of the page showcasing movies and shows
  that are currently running.
- Clicking on any movie or show will show you the details of them.
- The website has a search function on the homepage with pagination of
  the results.
